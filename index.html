    <h2>{ THE GRATITUDE KIT }</h2>
    <h3>Here's a little bit about the workshop:</h3>
    <p>Life is not a straight line. Speed bumps, setbacks, ups and downs. Big ups. Big downs. Big wins. Big losses. And so so many in betweens. Life comes with a whole pile of hopes, assumptions, expectations and beliefs. How life "should" go. But as you and I both know, sometimes life doesn't go as planned. We get stuck. We get lost. We get hurt. </p>

    <p>The remedy? Gratitude. </p>
    <p>And gratitude ... is a PRACTICE. </p>

    <p> Having a GRATITUDE PRACTICE about pausing and noticing, reflection and awareness. Even when we don't FEEL grateful, we can still practice. Gratitude not only has a positive ripple effect on our physical, emotional, and mental health, but it makes us more resilient, joyful, and creative.  It transforms what we have into enough.</p>

    <p>More than enough.</p>

    <p>Simply put, gratitude rocks! And together we're going to create our very own customized gratitude kit.</p>

    <p>This kit will create a whole-hearted ripple of love throughout your life, and those around you.</p>

    <p>In this workshop, you will create and take home a gratitude kit that includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>whole h'arted thank you cards</li>
      <li>a personalized gratitude journal</li>
      <li>your very own 2014 gratitude calendar</li>
      <li>a supply of gratitude rocks</li>
      <li>a plan to put this into action + a whole pile of inspiration!</li>
    </ul>  
    

  <p><em>"Gratitude has the ability to pull us into the now. To pause. It has magnetic energy that grows and expands and attracts possibility to everything it touches. When we focus on what and who we are grateful for, transformation follows. You will be changed. You will spread change. It's a practice and it takes practice. It's not about waiting for things to happen, to be perfect, to be extraordinary - it is your gratitude practice that will shift the way you see the ordinary, the every day. Your gratitude starter kit will give you the skills, tools, ideas, and momentum to keep your gratitude practice going throughout the entire year...and beyond.</em></p>

  <p><em>When we embody, express, and spread gratitude our heart feels lighter, brighter, and whole. Gratitude changes our perspective. Gratitude strengthens our work and our relationships - with those we love, and with our SELF - because gratitude gives as much to the sender as the receiver."</em>- Kate</p>
